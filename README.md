# SKILLUP

Hi Everyone, üëã
I'm a PG pursuing Student üßë‚Äçüéì, I choose SkillUp (Skill Enhancement Web App) as my major project because I have released many times that while studying hard to fulfill our dreams we tend to only focus on theortical part of our studies and ignore our natural skills, extra-curricular activities and interest which can be a good source of reducing Stress specially in student life and can help in improving focus.
But, The major problem arises is that from where we can get all these stuff ? Most of the resources on sites like Udemy, Skillshare are costly, so what about Unpreviledge or Financially Weak Students ?
Hence, considering all these thoughts, I have tried to develope ,SkillUp which can be used by anyone to follow up their interests and add some new skills in their Skillset through Video Lessons and Blogs. To make it more authenticate features like "Live session" had been added which makes learning a skill more easier and faster.

There can be 2 types of Users on this application :-
- Learner :- Anybody who wants gain some skills
- Volunteer :- A student, Professional, or anybody who is enough skilled to teach someone else about their mastered skill.

However, an individual can only register themself either as Learner or Volunteer but not both.

# Learner
To register as Learner an Individual will have to fill up 2 forms while registering i.e. Personal Information Form & Educational Background Form.
# Volunteer
To register as Volunteer an Individual will have to fill up 3 forms while registering i.e Personal Information Form, Educational Background Form & Document Submition.
It is neccessary to submit Document for eligibilty criteria to become a Volunteer, Admin got all Rights to restrict the account which is identified as with fraud or misleading eligibility documents 

# Here are Some feauters offered by application :-
- Skill Oriented Blogs
- Free Video Lessons & Courses
- Free Live Sessions

Volunteer, got the power to create a new session. Everytime the Volunteer will create a new session, he/she will get notified through email. After the session get 
published on the site Learner can join thesession through the Session Ticket via Online meeting application like Zoom, Webex etc.
